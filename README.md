# aws-rds-mysql-backup-restore
Backing up database from on-premises and restoring into rds 

Use-Case:
It will make backup of your on-premises DB data and restore it RDS. 

Advantage:

ðŸ”¹ Cloud Migration Readiness

You showed how an on-prem database (Oracle VM) can be migrated to AWS RDS MySQL.

This is exactly what companies do when they move workloads to the cloud.

Advantage: practical experience in cloud migration.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Backup & Disaster Recovery

Using mysqldump + Amazon S3 ensures data is safely stored in the cloud.

If the on-prem VM fails, the backup in S3 + restore process ensures business continuity.

Advantage: Resilient, fault-tolerant system design.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Cost & Maintenance Reduction

RDS is fully managed (patching, backups, scaling) â†’ no need to maintain your own DB server.

Advantage: Hands-on with managed services, which is what enterprises prefer for cost savings.

ðŸ”¹ 4. Automation & DevOps Skills

You automated with shell scripts and AWS CLI (instead of manual steps).

Advantage: Shows automation mindset â†’ essential in DevOps/Cloud roles.

ðŸ”¹ 5. Scalability & High Availability

Migrating from a local VM â†’ RDS means your DB can scale vertically (bigger instance) or horizontally (read replicas).

Advantage: Cloud-native scalability experience.

ðŸ”¹ 6. Security & Best Practices

Data moved securely to S3 (can enable encryption, IAM roles).

RDS MySQL allows restricted access with security groups.

Advantage: Understanding of secure cloud data handling.
